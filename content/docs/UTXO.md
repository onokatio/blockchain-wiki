# UTXO

'''UTXO''' stands for Unspent Transaction (TX) Output. Every on-chain bitcoin
[[transaction]] sends bitcoin to one or more [[address]]es, from at least zero
(in case of a [[coinbase]] transcation) addresses.

A bitcoin [[wallet]] balance is actually the sum of the UTXOs controlled by the
wallet's private keys.

## UTXO set

The ''UTXO set'' is the collection of all addresses with unspent outputs.

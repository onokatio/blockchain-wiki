:''For the business, see [[Coinbase (business)]].''

The '''coinbase''' is the content of the 'input' of a generation [[transaction]]. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing. 

The coinbase can contain any arbitrary data. The [[genesis block]] famously contains the dated title of a newspaper article in The Times:
 The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

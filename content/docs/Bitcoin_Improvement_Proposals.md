A '''Bitcoin Improvement Proposal''' ('''BIP''') is a design document for
introducing features or information to Bitcoin. This is the standard way of
communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure.

The first BIP ([[BIP 0001]]) was submitted by Amir Taaki on 2011-08-19 and
described what a BIP is.

== Types == There are three types of BIPs:

- '''Standards Track BIPs''' - Changes to the network protocol, block or
  transaction validation, or anything affecting interoperability.
- '''Informational BIPs''' - Design issues, general guidelines. This type of BIP
  is NOT for proposing new features and do not represent community consensus
- '''Process BIPs''' - Describes or proposes a change in process. Similar to
  Standards BIPs but apply outside the Bitcoin protocol.

== Layers == [[BIP 0123]] established four layers for Standards BIPs:

# '''Consensus'''<ref>Further divided into [[hardfork|hard]] and [[softfork]]s.</ref>

# '''Peer Services'''

# '''API/RPC'''

# '''Applications'''

== Workflow == As described in [[BIP 0001]] the workflow of a BIP is as follows:
